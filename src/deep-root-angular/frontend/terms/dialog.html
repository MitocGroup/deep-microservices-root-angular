            www.adtechmedia.io (the "Site").

        <h4>About the Site</h4>
        <div class="text-block">
            The Site provides access to AdTechMedia, an advertising platform with micropayments capabilities
            for media content monetization (the "Platform").
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            The "Service" is defined as any service provided or enabled via the Platform.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            The Platform empowers publishers and content providers (the "Business Customers") to generate
            complementary revenue streams that are immune to ad blocking software.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            The Business Customers may provide text, images, software, videos and/or other material
            on their own web sites or web applications, including user-generated material (the "Content").
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            The Business Customers can easily and seamlessly integrate the Platform into their web sites
            or web applications, offering their web users (the "Content Consumers") options to either pay
            for the Content out of their pockets through micropayments or watch advertising to continue
            consuming the Content for free.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            The Site allows the Business Customers to register for the Service. As discussed in
            <a href="https://www.adtechmedia.io/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, when you register for the Service,
            you'll be asked to provide your email address and optional password. Further, Business Customers
            will be required to provide certain information about themselves and their company, such as
            first name and last name, company name, employer identification number or tax identification number,
            bank account number, and billing address.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            Content Consumers will be required to provide certain information such as first name, last name,
            and email address, as well as information about their payment gateway accounts, such as
            (but not limited to) Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Amazon Payments, Stripe (the "Payment Gateways").
            The Payment Gateways will generate time-limited identity tokens, which the Platform
            will retain for further use.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            Also, please note that the Site is under constant development. New features may be added frequently,
            so it's important to check back to this page for updates.
        </div>

        <h4>Paid Services</h4>
        <div class="text-block">
            The Content Consumers are charged for access to the Content by the Business Customers
            only when they choose to pay using the Platform's micropayments feature. All micropayment
            transactions within a month are consolidated and, if they meet the minimum payment limit
            imposed by the Payment Gateways, are charged to the Content Consumers as one transaction
            to the associated payment option.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            The Content Consumers are charged via the web sites or web applications for the Business Customers
            using the payment option specified on the Business Customer's web site or web application,
            which may have its own legal terms.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            During the first 5 (five) days of the month following the month in which funds from
            the Content Consumers were received, the Company will consolidate all amounts collected from
            the Content Consumers in the previous month. Unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement,
            the Company will retain 30% (thirty percent) of each transaction collected from the Content Consumers
            (the "Fee") and transfer the remaining balance to the Business Customers.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            You can terminate your use of the Service, change your password, and otherwise manage your account

            at least 14 (fourteen) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service
